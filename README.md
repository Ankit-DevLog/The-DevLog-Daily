# 📈 The DevLog Daily: Consistency Dashboard
### Ankit Kushwaha | BCA Student @ Govt. TRS College

Welcome to the heart of my **0 to Dev** journey! 

I created this repository to track my daily progress as a developer in Rewa, MP. Instead of writing a diary entry every day, I let my **Commit History** tell the story of my consistency.

### 🎯 What I am building:
* ☕ **Java Mastery:** Solving logic problems and software fundamentals.
* 🌐 **Web Foundations:** Crafting semantic and high-end HTML structures.
* 🔐 **Cybersecurity:** Exploring ethical hacking and digital security.

### 📊 How to Track My Progress:
Aapko is README ko bar-bar check karne ki zaroorat nahi hai. Meri mehnat dekhne ke liye:
1. **Contribution Graph:** Check out the green squares on my [Main Profile](https://github.com/Ankit-DevLog) to see my daily activity.
2. **Commit History:** Tap on the "Commits" section of this repo to see exactly what I learned today.
